# EIP-7702 Relaying Transactions Demo

This repository is a demonstration of how to relay transactions using [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702).

> ⚠️ **Note:** At the time of this repository's creation, common wallets do **not yet support** the new transaction type introduced in EIP-7702.  
> As a result, this demo uses a **Private Key Account** instead of a **JSON-RPC Account**.
